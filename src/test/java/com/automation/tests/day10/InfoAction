//builder pattern => you put one method then you can take action
//builder pattern == chaining methods
//what is build?
//if you have multiple actions you have to put build
//to combine a couple of actions.
//build() is needed when you have couple of actions
//build combines the action; perform; starts the action
//in this example; first we move to one image then second so we used build
//always end with perform
//perform does not click, it starts the action, execute the event
//you can perform click, drag and drop etc
//actions class has different implementations
//moveToElement returns instance of action class that's why we can chain them
